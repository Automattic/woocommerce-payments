 * WooPayments wrapper markup rendered on plugins page.
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/plugins-page/plugins-page-wrapper.php
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see https://woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
 * @package WooCommerce\Payments\Templates\PluginsPage
 * @version 1.0.0
