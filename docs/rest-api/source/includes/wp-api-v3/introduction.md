# Introduction

WooCommerce Payments REST APIs build upon the WooCommerce REST interface which itself extends the WordPress REST APIs. Consuming, testing and debugging WCPay APIs is exactly the same as Woo APIs.

For requirements, request/response format, and other details refer to the [WooCommerce REST API docs](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#introduction).
