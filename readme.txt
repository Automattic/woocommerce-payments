Securely accept credit and debit cards on your site. Manage transactions without leaving your WordPress dashboard. Only with WooCommerce Payments.

== Description ==

**Payments made simple, with no monthly fees – designed exclusively for WooCommerce stores.**

Securely accept major credit and debit cards, and allow customers to pay you directly without leaving your WooCommerce store. View and manage transactions from one convenient place – your WordPress dashboard.

See payments, track cash flow into your bank account, manage refunds, and stay on top of disputes without the hassle of having to log into a separate payment processor.

**Manage transactions from the comfort of your store**

Features previously only available on your payment provider’s website are now part of your store’s **integrated payments dashboard**. This enables you to:

- View the details of [payments, refunds, and other transactions](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-4).
- View and respond to [disputes and chargebacks](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/disputes/).
- [Track deposits](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-5) into your bank account or debit card.

**Pay as you go**

WooCommerce Payments is **free to install**, with **no setup fees or monthly fees**. Pay-as-you-go fees start at 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for U.S.-issued cards. [Read more about transaction fees](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/fees/).

**Supported by the WooCommerce team**

Our global support team is available to answer questions you may have about WooCommerce Payments installation, setup, or use. For assistance, [open a ticket on WooCommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/?select=5278104).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What countries and currencies are supported? =

If you are an individual or business based in the United States, you can sign-up with WooCommerce Payments. After completing sign up, you can accept payments from customers anywhere in the world in USD.

We are actively planning to expand into additional countries based on your interest. Let us know where you would like to [see WooCommerce Payments launch next](https://woocommerce.com/payments/#request-invite).

[Learn more](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/countries/).

= Why is a WordPress.com account and connection required? =

WooCommerce Payments uses the WordPress.com connection to authenticate each request, connecting your store with our payments partner.

= How do I set up a store for a client? =

If you are setting up a store that will process real payments, have the site owner complete the WooCommerce Payments setup. This ensures that the correct business details are set on the account during [onboarding](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/#section-3).

After the store setup has been completed, you can use [Test Mode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/) to simulate payments, refunds, and disputes.

If you are setting up WooCommerce Payments on a development or test site that will **never need to process real payments**, try [Dev Mode](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/testing/dev-mode/#section-1).

= How is WooCommerce Payments related to Stripe? =

WooCommerce Payments is proudly powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). When you sign up for WooCommerce Payments, your personal and business information is verified with Stripe and stored in an account connected to the WooCommerce Payments service. This account is then used in the background for managing your business account information and activity via WooCommerce Payments. [Learn more](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/payments/powered-by-stripe/).

= Are there Terms of Service and data usage policies? =
