      <Paragraphs>
        Determine if your customer was incorrectly charged multiple times.
        If they were not, collect any and all information documenting that each payment was made separately, such as copies of receipts. If the receipts donâ€™t include the items purchased, be sure to include an itemized list. Each receipt should clearly indicate that the payments are for separate purchases of items or services. If youâ€™ve been able to get in touch with the customer you should be sure to address any concerns they had in your evidence.
        If there have been two or more separate payments, you should get in touch with your customer. If you understand what their complaint is, there is a chance for you to explain the misunderstanding or to make it right. If youâ€™re able to resolve the issue with your customer, you can ask that they withdraw the dispute.
        Even if your customer agrees to withdraw the dispute, you must still submit appropriate evidence using the forms on the next screen. Simply saying that your customer is going to withdraw the dispute is not sufficient evidence.

        This is the most common reason for a dispute, and happens when a cardholder claims that they didnâ€™t authorize the payment. This can happen if the card was lost or stolen and used to make a fraudulent purchase. It can also happen if the cardholder doesnâ€™t recognize the payment as it appears on the billing statement from their card issuer.

      <Paragraphs>
        Try to get in touch with your customer. Sometimes people forget about payments they make or donâ€™t recognize the way they appear on their card statement. If this is the case, ask them to contact their card issuer and let them know they no longer dispute the transaction.
        Even if your customer agrees to withdraw the dispute, you must still submit appropriate evidence using the forms on the next screen. Simply saying that your customer is going to withdraw the dispute is not sufficient evidence.
        It may be more efficientâ€”and provide a better customer experienceâ€”to accept an accidental dispute and charge the customer again, if appropriate. Even when a dispute is withdrawn, it usually takes approximately 75 days to be finalized. Remember, it doesnâ€™t matter to the card networks whether you win or lose a dispute; what matters is how many disputes a business receives, regardless of how many disputes are won.

        How to respond
      </h3>
      <Paragraphs>
        If the product or service is as described, provide specific information (invoice, contract, etc.) to refute the cardholderâ€™s claims. Quality disputes are where the customer does not agree with the condition of merchandise or service received (e.g., a car repair situation or quality of a hotel room). There may be instances where you will need to obtain a neutral third-party opinion to help corroborate your claim against the cardholder. Provide as much specific information and documentation as possible to refute the cardholderâ€™s claims. It is recommended that you address each point that the cardholder has made.
        If the customer has not yet returned the product or canceled the service, provide specific information to that effect. You should double-check your incoming shipping records to verify that you have not received a return before you respond. If you have processed a credit or reversal for this transaction, provide evidence of this which includes the amount and date processed.
        For products that have been repaired or replaced, provide evidence that the cardholder agreed to a repair or replacement, it has been received by the customer, and the repair or replacement has not since been disputed.
        If your customer made no attempt to return the product or cancel the service, or if you provided a replacement product or service, make sure to note that as well.
        If the customer withdraws their dispute you should still submit evidence using the forms on the next screen. Be sure to provide a letter or email from the cardholder stating that they are no longer in dispute.

        How to respond
      </h3>
      <Paragraphs>
        First, try to get in touch with your customer. Sometimes people forget about payments they make or donâ€™t recognize the way they appear on their card statement. If this is the case, ask them to contact their card issuer and let them know they no longer dispute the transaction. Even if your customer agrees to withdraw the dispute, you must still submit appropriate evidence. Simply saying that your customer is going to withdraw the dispute is not sufficient evidence.
        It may be more efficientâ€”and provide a better customer experienceâ€”to accept an accidental dispute and charge the customer again, if appropriate. Even when a dispute is withdrawn, it usually takes approximately 75 days to be finalized. Remember, it doesnâ€™t matter to the card networks whether you win or lose a dispute; what matters is how many disputes a business receives, regardless of how many disputes are won.
