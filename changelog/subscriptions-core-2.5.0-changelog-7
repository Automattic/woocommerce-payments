Deprecated the "wcs_{type}_meta_query" dynamic hook used to alter the database query used to fetch the meta data to copy between subscriptions and renewal orders. There is no direct replacement. Third-parties should use the "wc_subscriptions_{type}_data" or "wc_subscriptions_object_data" hooks instead.
