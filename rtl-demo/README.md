# React testing library demo

There are some basic tests in this folder to demonstrate the most common use cases.

`index.test.js` contains different tests.
`components.js` contains some fake form component with custom input components and action buttons component.
`client/disputes/evidence/test/index.js` has existing tests rewritten with react testing library.
